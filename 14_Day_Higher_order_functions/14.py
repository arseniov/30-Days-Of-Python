# ## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 14

# ```py
countries = ['Estonia', 'Finland', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'Norway', 'Iceland']
names = ['Asabeneh', 'Lidiya', 'Ermias', 'Abraham']
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
misc = ["Estonia", 4, 1, "Sweden", 9, "Denmark", 3, "Abraham", 5]
# ```

# ### Exercises: Level 1

# 1. Explain the difference between map, filter, and reduce.


# 2. Explain the difference between higher order function, closure and decorator


# 3. Define a call function before map, filter or reduce, see examples.


# 4. Use for loop to print each country in the countries list.

# for country in countries:
#     print(country)


# 5. Use for to print each name in the names list.
# for name in names:
#     print(name)

# 6. Use for to print each number in the numbers list.
# for number in numbers:
#     print(number)


# ### Exercises: Level 2

# 1. Use map to create a new list by changing each country to uppercase in the countries list
# def uppercase(country):
#     return country.upper()

# countries_upper = map(uppercase, countries)
# print(list(countries_upper))


# 1. Use map to create a new list by changing each number to its square in the numbers list
# def square(number):
#     return number ** 2

# numbers_square = map(square, numbers)
# print(list(numbers_square))

# 1. Use map to change each name to uppercase in the names list
# def uppercase(name):
#     return name.upper()

# names_uppercase = map(uppercase, names)
# print(list(names_uppercase))

# 1. Use filter to filter out countries containing 'land'.
# def land_filter(country):
#     if "land" not in country:
#         return True
#     return False

# countries_filtered = filter(land_filter, countries)
# print(list(countries_filtered))

# 1. Use filter to filter out countries having exactly six characters.
# def land_filter(country):
#     if len(country) != 6:
#         return True
#     return False

# countries_filtered = filter(land_filter, countries)
# print(list(countries_filtered))

# 1. Use filter to filter out countries containing six letters and more in the country list.
# def land_filter(country):
#     if len(country) < 6:
#         return True
#     return False

# countries_filtered = filter(land_filter, countries)
# print(list(countries_filtered))

# 1. Use filter to filter out countries starting with an 'E'
# def land_filter(country):
#     if country[0] != "E":
#         return True
#     return False

# countries_filtered = filter(land_filter, countries)
# print(list(countries_filtered))

# 1. Chain two or more list iterators (eg. arr.map(callback).filter(callback).reduce(callback))


# 1. Declare a function called get_string_lists which takes a list as a parameter and then returns a list containing only string items.


# 1. Use reduce to sum all the numbers in the numbers list.
# import functools

# def sum_numbers(a, b):
#     return int(a) + int(b)

# sum = functools.reduce(sum_numbers, numbers)
# print(sum)

# 1. Use reduce to concatenate all the countries and to produce this sentence: Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland are north European countries
import functools

def concatenate(a, b):
    return a + ", " + b

concatenate_countries = functools.reduce(concatenate, countries)
print(str(concatenate_countries))

# 1. Declare a function called categorize_countries that returns a list of countries with some common pattern (you can find the [countries list](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python/blob/master/data/countries.py) in this repository as countries.js(eg 'land', 'ia', 'island', 'stan')).


# 1. Create a function returning a dictionary, where keys stand for starting letters of countries and values are the number of country names starting with that letter.


# 2. Declare a get_first_ten_countries function - it returns a list of first ten countries from the countries.js list in the data folder.


# 1. Declare a get_last_ten_countries function that returns the last ten countries in the countries list.

# ### Exercises: Level 3

# 1. Use the countries_data.py (https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python/blob/master/data/countries-data.py) file and follow the tasks below:
#    - Sort countries by name, by capital, by population


#    - Sort out the ten most spoken languages by location.


#    - Sort out the ten most populated countries
